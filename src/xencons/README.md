This generates two files called kdfiles32.txt and kdfiles64.txt which can
be used as map files for the .kdfiles WinDBG command.

sdv.py
------

This runs Static Driver Verifier on the source.

clean.py
--------

This removes any files not checked into the repository and not covered by
the .gitignore file.

get_xen_headers.py

This will import any necessary headers from a given tag of that Xen
repository at git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git.
